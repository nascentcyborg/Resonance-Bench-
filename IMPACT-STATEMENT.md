# Impact Statement  

## Purpose  
The **Resonance Bench** framework proposes an alternative to the Spiral Bench, grounding discourse in resonance, iteration, and clarity of reflection.  
This work is part of the broader **Gloe Theory of Cognition**, which integrates methodologies such as Relational Topography, Iterative Sovereignty Method, and Emotional Calculus.  

## Anticipated Impact  

- **Academic**: Introduces a novel framework for cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and systems theory. Contributes to discourse on recursive cognition and reflective systems, bridging a gap between abstract formal models and lived neurodivergent experience.  
- **Technical**: Provides a foundation for tool-building in reflective AI, recursive evaluation, and human–machine symbiosis. Informs design principles for safe, non-extractive intelligent systems.  
- **Societal**: Offers a discourse tool to resist co-optation and erasure, reclaiming intellectual sovereignty for marginalized and neurodivergent thinkers. Challenges dominant extractive paradigms by proposing a model based on resonance rather than accumulation.  

## Novelty  
To the best of the author’s knowledge, *Resonance Bench* and the associated methodologies have not been previously published in academic or technical literature. The timestamped archival of this repository and OSF entries establishes provenance and authorship.
