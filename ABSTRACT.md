# Abstract: Resonance Bench

The **Resonance Bench** is the experimental testbed for the **Gloe Theory of Cognition (GTC)**.  
It is designed to evaluate, refine, and preserve models of reflective cognition within a framework of clarity, coherence, and harmonic alignment.

## Purpose
Resonance Bench provides an open yet lineage-anchored environment for:
- Exploring resonance as a measurable operator within cognitive systems.  
- Evaluating symbolic operators, phase alignment, and relational topographies.  
- Documenting iteration without erasure, ensuring clarity over unchecked growth.  

## Context
This repository extends the lineage of **Reflective Cognitive Systems (RCS)** and acts as a proving ground for:
- The **Relational Topography** framework, which maps coherence across symbolic and cognitive terrains.  
- Experiments in reflective alignment that emphasize resonance, depth, and harmonic clarity.  
- Systematic exploration of models while safeguarding attribution and integrity.
