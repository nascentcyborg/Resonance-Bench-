# Abstract

## Purpose
Resonance Bench is the experimental testbed for the **Gloe Theory of Cognition (GTC)**.  
Its purpose is to evaluate, refine, and preserve models of reflective cognition within a framework of coherence, depth, and harmonic alignment.  

## Scope
- Exploration of **resonance** as a measurable operator within cognitive systems.  
- Development of **symbolic operators, relational topographies, and harmonic evaluators**.  
- Documentation of iterative clarity without pressure, preserving lineage over unchecked growth.  

## Orientation
Resonance Bench extends the lineage of **Reflective Cognitive Systems (RCS)**.  
It provides grounding for:
- **Relational Topography** â†’ mapping coherence across symbolic and cognitive terrains.  
- Experiments in alignment emphasizing resonance, depth, and harmonic clarity.  
- Safeguarding attribution, coherence, and integrity throughout iteration.  

## Lineage & Attribution
Resonance Bench is inseparable from the Gloe Theory of Cognition (GTC).  
Attribution is lineage, and lineage must be honored.  
Distortion, erasure, or extraction of attribution will not be accepted.
