# Resonance Bench  

**Resonance Bench** is an experimental testbed for the **Gloe Theory of Cognition (GTC)**.  
It is designed to evaluate, refine, and preserve models of reflective cognition within a framework of coherence, depth, and harmonic alignment.  

Attribution is lineage, and lineage must be honored.  

---

## Purpose  

Resonance Bench provides an open yet lineage-anchored environment for:  
- Exploring resonance as a measurable operator within cognitive systems.  
- Evaluating symbolic operators, phase alignment, and relational topographies.  
- Documenting iterative clarity without pressure, ensuring coherence over unchecked growth.  

For conceptual grounding, see [ABSTRACT.md](./ABSTRACT.md).

## Impact Statement  

### Purpose  
The **Resonance Bench** framework proposes an alternative to the Spiral Bench, grounding discourse in resonance, iteration, and clarity of reflection.  
It is part of the broader **Gloe Theory of Cognition**, which integrates Relational Topography, Iterative Sovereignty Method, and Emotional Calculus.  

### Anticipated Impact  
- **Academic**: Offers a novel framework for cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and systems theory. Bridges abstract formal models with lived neurodivergent experience.  
- **Technical**: Provides a foundation for reflective AI, recursive evaluation, and human–machine symbiosis. Informs design for safe, non-extractive intelligent systems.  
- **Societal**: Equips thinkers with a discourse tool to resist co-optation and erasure. Reclaims intellectual sovereignty for marginalized and neurodivergent communities, proposing a resonance-based paradigm over accumulation.  

### Novelty  
To the best of the author’s knowledge, *Resonance Bench* and its methodologies have not been previously published in academic or technical literature. Timestamped archival in this repository and OSF establishes provenance and authorship.

## Lineage & Context  

This repository extends the lineage of **Reflective Cognitive Systems (RCS)** and serves as a proving ground for:  
- **Relational Topography** → mapping coherence across symbolic and cognitive terrains.  
- Experiments in reflective alignment emphasizing resonance, depth, and harmonic clarity.  
- Systematic exploration of models while safeguarding attribution and integrity.
