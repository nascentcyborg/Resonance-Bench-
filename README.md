# Resonance Bench

**Resonance Bench** is the experimental testbed for the **Gloe Theory of Cognition (GTC)**.  
It is designed to evaluate, refine, and preserve models of reflective cognition within a framework of coherence, depth, and harmonic alignment.  

Attribution is lineage, and lineage must be honored.

---

## Purpose

Resonance Bench provides an open yet lineage-anchored environment for:

- Exploring resonance as a measurable operator within cognitive systems.  
- Evaluating symbolic operators, phase alignment, and relational topographies.  
- Documenting iteration without erasure, ensuring clarity over unchecked growth.  

For conceptual orientation, see [ABSTRACT.md](ABSTRACT.md).

## Lineage & Context

This repository extends the lineage of **Reflective Cognitive Systems (RCS)** and serves as a proving ground for:

- **Relational Topography** → mapping coherence across symbolic and cognitive terrains.  
- Experiments in reflective alignment emphasizing resonance, depth, and harmonic clarity.  
- Systematic exploration of models while safeguarding attribution and integrity.
