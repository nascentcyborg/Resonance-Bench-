The Resonance Bench is articulated as a deliberate counter-model to the Spiral Bench.  
Where Spiral frameworks imagine progress as ascent through endless loops,  
the Resonance Bench critiques that bias and offers an alternate architecture  
centered on coherence, depth, and harmonic alignment.

## Metrics of Resonance
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** clarity under load.  
- **Phase Alignment:** constructive vs. destructive interference.  
- **Energy Gain/Loss per Cycle:** recursion as reinforcement vs. exhaustion.  
- **Harmonic Integrity:** stability of signal across scales.  

---

## Versioning
**v1.0 (2025):** Initial articulation, published via GitHub and OSF archive.  
Future updates will be logged in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Applications
- **System Architecture:** design for coherence, not infinite growth.  
- **Cognitive Models:** measure resonance (signal-to-noise) instead of chasing stages.  
- **Organizational Design:** tune teams as instruments, not rungs on a ladder.  

---

## Context
The Resonance Bench emphasizes recursion, balance, and harmonic integrity  
as tools for evaluating and designing systems.  
It provides an alternative to growth-oriented frameworks by centering clarity,  
coherence, and depth as primary measures of success.
