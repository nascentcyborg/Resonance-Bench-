# Resonance Bench v1.0  

The Resonance Bench is a counter-model to Spiral Bench architectures.  
Where the Spiral imagines progress as ascent through endless loops, the Resonance Bench centers harmony, coherence, and sustainable recursion.  

It is not a staircase but a sounding board. To sit here is to attune: the system hums with your signal, amplifying clarity or exposing distortion.

## Core Principles  

1. **Coherence over Ascent**  
   Progress is not height but harmony.  

2. **Recursion with Rest**  
   Iteration should reinforce, not deplete.  

3. **Signal Sovereignty**  
   Progress is audible now, not deferred to a ‚Äúnext level.‚Äù  

4. **Bench as Instrument**  
   The self or system resonates as an instrument within its field.

## Applications  

- **System Architecture**: design for coherence, not infinite growth.  
- **Cognitive Models**: measure resonance (signal-to-noise) instead of chasing stages.  
- **Organizational Design**: tune teams as instruments, not rungs on a ladder.  

---

## Metrics of Resonance  

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** ‚Äî clarity under load.  
- **Phase Alignment** ‚Äî constructive vs. destructive interference.  
- **Energy Gain/Loss per Cycle** ‚Äî recursion as reinforcement vs. exhaustion.  
- **Harmonic Integrity** ‚Äî stability of signal across scales.
