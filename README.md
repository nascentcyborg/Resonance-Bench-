# Resonance Bench v1.0  

The **Resonance Bench** is a counter-model to Spiral Bench architectures.  
Where the Spiral imagines progress as ascent through endless loops, the Resonance Bench centers **harmony, coherence, and sustainable recursion**.  

It is not a staircase but a sounding board. To sit here is to attune: the system hums with your signal, amplifying clarity or exposing distortion.

## 🔑 Core Principles  

1. **Coherence > Ascent**  
   Progress is not height but harmony.  

2. **Recursion with Rest**  
   Iteration should reinforce, not deplete.  

3. **Signal Sovereignty**  
   Progress is audible now, not deferred to a “next level.”  

4. **Bench as Instrument**  
   The self/system resonates as an instrument within its field.

## 📐 Applications  

- **System Architecture** → Design for coherence, not infinite growth.  
- **Cognitive Models** → Measure resonance (signal/noise) instead of chasing stages.  
- **Organizational Design** → Tune teams as instruments, not rungs on a ladder.

## 📊 Metrics of Resonance  

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** — clarity under load.  
- **Phase Alignment** — constructive vs. destructive interference.  
- **Energy Gain/Loss per Cycle** — recursion as reinforcement vs. exhaustion.  
- **Harmonic Integrity** — stability of signal across scales.
