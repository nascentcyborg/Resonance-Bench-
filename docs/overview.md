# Resonance Bench — Overview

## Abstract
The Resonance Bench is a counter-model to Spiral Bench architectures. Where Spiral imagines progress as ascent through endless, energy-draining loops, Resonance reframes progress as harmonic coherence: alignment, clarity of signal, and sustainable recursion. This document formalizes the core concepts, metrics, and design patterns so the model can be evaluated, implemented, and extended.

## Background: Why a Retort to the Spiral Bench
- **Spiral assumption:** iteration → momentum → higher plane.
- **Observed costs:** deferred arrival, exhaustion, and telos ambiguity (“next level” never specified).
- **Resonance claim:** systems should be judged by *depth and coherence*, not *distance and height*.

---

## Definitions
- **Resonance:** constructive interaction between system signals that increases clarity and stability.
- **Coherence:** degree to which components reinforce rather than interfere.
- **Rest cycle:** bounded recursion that returns the system to a stable baseline without loss.
- **Field:** the environment in which a system resonates (technical, organizational, cultural).

## Core Principles
1. **Coherence over Ascent** — measure depth/alignment, not laddering.
2. **Recursion with Rest** — cycles should reinforce energy/state.
3. **Signal Sovereignty** — evaluate present-state fidelity; avoid deferred telos.
4. **Bench as Instrument** — design systems that *resonate* with their field.

## Metrics (Operationalization)
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** clarity under realistic load.
- **Phase Alignment:** proportion of constructive vs. destructive interference across components.
- **Energy Gain/Loss per Cycle:** ΔE after a recursion period (should be ≥ 0 for sustainable systems).
- **Harmonic Integrity:** stability of key signals across scales (component → subsystem → whole).
