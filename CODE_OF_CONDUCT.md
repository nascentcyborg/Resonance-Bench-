# Code of Conduct

## Guiding Principles

The Resonance Bench community is built on clarity, coherence, and respect for lineage.  
All participants are expected to uphold these values when engaging with this project.

  Acknowledge and preserve the established lineage of the Gloe Theory of Cognition (GTC).  
  Attribution is required and may not be removed or obscured.

- **Integrity in Contribution**  
  Engage with rigor, clarity, and honesty.  
  No distortion, erasure, or extraction of models will be accepted.

  Expansion must serve coherence, depth, and harmonic alignment.  
  Contributions that obscure or dilute these principles will be declined.
